# Abstract
Internet of Things (IoT) is the upcoming generation of networks, in which everything is connected to the others via the Internet. Not only PCs, tablets, and smartphones, but also automobiles, refrigerators, and even dust-boxes can communicate with each other in the IoT. Nowadays, a lot of novel applications and services are emerging in the IoT.

This class offers you hands-on exercises on building a system working in the IoT. The system is a small web server with some sensors for recording environmental data around it. To build the web server in this class, you use Raspberry Pi as a micro-computer and Node.js as a platform for web application development. Node.js makes it possible for you to make a server-side application in JavaScript easily. In this class, you will learn how to implement a web application on a micro-controller with some sensors "with Japanese students."
